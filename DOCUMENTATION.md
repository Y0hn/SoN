## Inspirations

As an underworld
The phrase Nawia (Polish) or Nav (used across Slavic tongues) was also utilised as a name for the Slavonic underworld, ruled by the god Veles, enclosed away from the world either by a living sea or river, according to some beliefs located deep underground.[3] According to Ruthenian folklore, Veles lived on a swamp in the centre of Nav, where he sat on a golden throne at the base of the Cosmic Tree, wielding a sword.[3] Symbolically, the Nav has also been described as a huge green plainâ€”pasture, onto which Veles guides souls.[3] The entrance to Nav was guarded by a Zmey.[3] It was believed the souls would later be reborn on earth.[7] It is highly likely that these folk beliefs were the inspiration behind the neopagan idea of Jav, Prav and Nav in the literary forgery known as the Book of Veles.
