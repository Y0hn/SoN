            The theme of our annual project was the 2D multiplayer game Souls of Nav in Unity. The reason for our choice for the RPG was our positive experience with games of this type. While playing this kind of game, we experienced an engaging story in addition to thrilling battles. Such a story was set in a magical world with lots of interesting characters. We often had the opportunity to influence the development and ending of this story.

            Our game was rendered in two dimensions when viewed from above. The simplicity of this graphic allowed us to design separate elements to appropriately complement the overall theme of the game. The project's graphics were inspired by the successful games The Binding of Isaac, Don't Starve Together and Castle Wolfenstein.

            This work included the option of a multiplayer game mode. The game was thematically and narratively tuned to Slavic mythology. The main goal of the work was to bring mythological characters and stories from Slavic traditions into the virtual world. The motivation for choosing this theme was the need to preserve and disseminate Slovak culture in an innovative way that would appeal to the younger generation. Role-playing games provided an ideal format for such an intention. Combining mythological elements with gameplay inspired by Path of Exile. The main similarity was the complex skill system and extensive customization options.
